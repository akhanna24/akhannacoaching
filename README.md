# AKhanna Coaching
# Who am I?

My name is Aditya Khanna and I am a senior at the Academy for Allied Health Sciences in Scotch Plains. 
I started working out during the pandemic in 2020 and quickly realized that it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
In 2021, I created AKhanna Coaching to provide free coaching to high schoolers in my community in order to help them work out properly and safely.
I recently created this website to continue coaching through video tutorials as I transition from high school to college.
