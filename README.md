# Who am I?

My name is Aditya Khanna and I am a senior at the Academy for Allied Health Sciences in Scotch Plains. 
I started working out during the pandemic in 2020 and quickly realized that it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
Since then, I have made this free coaching service to help people in my community work out properly.
